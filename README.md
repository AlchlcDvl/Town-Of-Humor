# NOTE: This is a Steam-only mod for Town of Salem, it will *NOT WORK* on other platforms.

# Changes

# Roles!
Roles have been renamed to add to the haha funni factor! Here they are and their new names.

# New messages!
Messages have been reworded and worked on to blend with the new role names!

# Color Coding!
All roles and messages are color coded to add to the wow factor of this mod!

# Message Styles!
A lot of the messages were of the "alert" status, so I've changed them to be more accurate based on their contents!

# Role Cards!
Role cards for each role have more info on them, even mentioning your limits!

# Investigation Changes!
- Blackmailers can now tell the difference between regular whispers and whispers they can read!
- Role results for Investigator, Consiglere, Witch, Coven Leader and Potion Master are now color coded for each role!
- Sheriff results are now color coded and add more info!
- Psychic visions are now color coded to indicate evil or good visions!
- Spy evil visits are color coded for Mafia and Coven visits to avoid confusion! (I've been there before, trust me)

# Misc Changes!
- Changed 'Scrolls' to 'Luck Stat Boosts'!
